[Chapter 1]

What is a program?
  code, a set of special instructions that tell the computer what to do

What is a computer language?
  syntax, rules for valid format and combinations of instructions

What is a statement?
  A group of words, numbers, and operators that perform a task

What is a variable?
  simple boxes that you can store any of your stuff in. They store values to be used by the program

What is an expression?
Any reference to a variable or value combined with operators

Name the expressions in the statement: a = b * 2;
  Assignment expression

What is an expression statement?
  an expression that stands alone, ex. b * 2

Interpreting the code is when ______________________________
  computer languages translate the code line by line, each time the program is running

Compiling is when ________________________
  A language translates the code BEFORE it is running

What is an operator?
  they perform actions on variables and values. Think math and Conditionals

What is are objects?
  values that hold other values at specific named locations called properties

What are types?
  Different representations for values, ex number, string, boolean

What is a literal value?
  Values that are included directly in the source code

In JS, coercion is _________________.
  When you convert between values. Ex value to string, string to a number

The primary purpose of variables is _______________________.
  To track a value as it changes (if it does) throughout the program.

What is state?
  Tracking the changes to values as your program runs

What is a block?  How is a block defined in JS?
  A group of statements together usually inside {} and followed after and 'if' statement

Conditionals are also know as _______________.
  Decisions

What is the job of a loop?
  Repeating a set of actions while the condition holds.

What is an iteration?
  Each time the loop block executes

A for loop has three clauses, which are: _________________________.
  initialization clause ( var i = 0 )
  conditional test clause ( i <= 9 )
  update clause ( i = i + 1 )

What is a function?
  A section of code that can be called by name which will run the code inside

What is an argument (aka parameter)?
  values you pass in

[Chapter 2]

What are the built-in types available in JS?
  string
  number
  boolean
  null and undefined
  object
  symbol

What is a property?
  named locations

Bracket notation is useful if _______________;
  you have a property name that has special characters in it. ex obj["hello world!"]

What are the two main types of value comparison?
  Equality and Inequality

The result of any comparison is ____________.
  boolean value (true or false)

What is explicit coercion?
  You can see the conversion in the code

What is implicit coercion?
  happens as non-obvious side effect of some other operation

List the 'falsy' values in JavaScript:
  " " empty string
  0. -0, NaN (invalid number)
  null undefined
  false

What is the difference between == and ===?
  == checks for value equality with coercion allowed
  === strict equality, no coercion allowed

In JS, variable names (including function names) must be valid __________.
  identifiers, a-z, A -Z, $, _

An identifier must start with (    ), (     ), ( ), or (  ).

What is hoisting?
  declaration is taken to belong to the entire scope and accessible everywhere

A function value should be thought of as an ____________.
  expression

You can think of closure as a way to _____________________________.
  "remember" and continue to access a function's scope

What is a module?
  let's you define private implementation details that are hidden from the outside world, as well as public API that is
  accessible from the outside

What is transpiling?
  converts your newer code into older code equivalents
